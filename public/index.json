This form of non-random assortment has long been predicted to play a role in many evolutionary processes because assortatively mated individuals are assumed to be genetically similar. However, this assumption may always hold for labile traits, or traits that are measured with error. For such traits, there is a variety of proximate mechanisms that can drive phenotypic resemblance between mated partners that, notably, have very different evolutionary repercussions. Bettering our understanding of the role of assortative mating in evolution will thus require insight into its proximate causes. To date, empirical research remains sparse, especially when for labile traits. This special issue aims to stimulate such research while promoting the usage and development of statistical approaches allowing the quantification of the relative roles of alternative proximate mechanisms causing assortative mating. To this end, we first describe how the phenotypic covariance between mated partners can be usefully partitioned into components that capture one or several of five distinct mechanisms. We then demonstrate why the importance of mechanisms causing genetic covariance between the traits of partners may often be overestimated. Finally, we detail how the evolutionary causes and consequences of the diverse mechanisms may be identified.","tags":null,"title":"A variance partitioning perspective of assortative mating: Proximate mechanisms and evolutionary implications","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Barbara Class","Daniel Powell","Julien Terraube","Greg Albery","Coralie Delme","Shweta Bansal","Celine Frere"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1635120000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1635120000,"objectID":"53f23216e5b8e536d649bfa0bda9005d","permalink":"https://barbaraclass.com/publication/class_etal_biorxiv_2021/","publishdate":"2021-10-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/class_etal_biorxiv_2021/","section":"publication","summary":"Emerging infectious fungal diseases (EIFDs) represent a major conservation concern worldwide.

First known to the reptile pet trade as a primary pathogen causing untreatable severe dermatomycosis, since 2013, Nb has emerged in a growing number of phylogenetically and ecologically distant free-living reptiles across Australia. Observing its emergence in a long-term study population of wild eastern water dragons (Intellagama lesueurii), we demonstrate the pathogen′s virulence-related genomic features, within-population spatiotemporal spread, and survival costs, all of which imply that Nb could pose a threat to Australian reptiles in the future.

Within species, consistent variation among individuals in food-hoarding behaviours may indicate the existence of individual strategies, as it likely captures intrinsic differences in how individuals cope with risks (e.g. starvation, pilferage). Using 17 years of data, we estimated the long-term repeatability of 10 food-hoarding behaviours in a population of Eurasian pygmy owls (Glaucidium passerinum), a small avian predator subject to high temporal fluctuations in its main prey abundance. We found low repeatability in the proportion of shrews and the average prey mass stored for both sexes, while females were moderately repeatable in the mass and the number of prey items stored. These two pairs of behaviours were tightly correlated among individuals and might represent two different sets of individual strategies to buffer against starvation risks.","tags":null,"title":"Estimating the long-term repeatability of food-hoarding behaviours in an avian predator","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Niels Dingemanse","Barbara Class","Benedikt Holtmann"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1606867200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1606867200,"objectID":"df8728f58f17e72e14aaace5ae1d7006","permalink":"https://barbaraclass.com/publication/dingemanse_etal_tree_2020/","publishdate":"2020-12-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/dingemanse_etal_tree_2020/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Nonrandom Mating for Behavior in the Wild?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David F Westneat","Yimen G Araya-Ajoy","Hassen Allegue","Barbara Class","Niels Dingemanse","Ned A Dochtermann","László Zsolt Garamszegi","Julien GA Martin","Shinichi Nakagawa","Denis Réale","Holger Schielzeth"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1598227200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1598227200,"objectID":"269116c77bedc8e28deb7cfdba47c2b3","permalink":"https://barbaraclass.com/publication/westneat_etal_jae_2020/","publishdate":"2020-09-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/westneat_etal_jae_2020/","section":"publication","summary":"Animal ecologists often collect hierarchically structured data and analyse these with linear mixed-effects models. Specific complications arise when the effect sizes of covariates vary on multiple levels (e.g. within vs. among subjects). Mean centring of covariates within subjects offers a useful approach in such situations, but is not without problems. A statistical model represents a hypothesis about the underlying biological process. Mean centring within clusters assumes that the lower level responses (e.g. within subjects) depend on the deviation from the subject mean (relative) rather than on the absolute scale of the covariate. This may or may not be biologically realistic. We show that mismatch between the nature of the generating (i.e. biological) process and the form of the statistical analysis produce major conceptual and operational challenges for empiricists. We explored the consequences of mismatches by simulating data with three response-generating processes differing in the source of correlation between a covariate and the response. These data were then analysed by three different analysis equations. We asked how robustly different analysis equations estimate key parameters of interest and under which circumstances biases arise. Mismatches between generating and analytical equations created several intractable problems for estimating key parameters. The most widely misestimated parameter was the among-subject variance in response. We found that no single analysis equation was robust in estimating all parameters generated by all equations. Importantly, even when response-generating and analysis equations matched mathematically, bias in some parameters arose when sampling across the range of the covariate was limited.

Empirical work on domesticated and wild outbred populations suggests that dominance genetic variance represents a substantial part of genetic variance, and theoretical work predicts that ignoring dominance can inflate estimates of additive genetic variance. Whether this issue is pervasive in natural systems is unknown, because we lack estimates of dominance variance in wild populations obtained in situ. Here, we estimate dominance and additive genetic variance, maternal variance, and other sources of nongenetic variance in eight traits measured in over 9000 wild nestlings linked through a genetically resolved pedigree. We find that dominance variance, when estimable, does not statistically differ from zero and represents a modest amount (2‐36%) of genetic variance. Simulations show that (1) inferences of all variance components for an average trait are unbiased; (2) the power to detect dominance variance is low; (3) ignoring dominance can mildly inflate additive genetic variance and heritability estimates but such inflation becomes substantial when maternal effects are also ignored. These findings hence suggest that dominance is a small source of phenotypic variance in the wild and highlight the importance of proper model construction for accurately estimating evolutionary potential.","tags":null,"title":"Can dominance genetic variance be ignored in evolutionary quantitative genetic analyses of wild populations?","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"My second post-doc on urban Eastern Water dragons (EWD, Intellagama Lesueurii) allowed me to extend my research to new questions at the intersection between social behaviour, disease ecology, and urban evolutionary ecology.

Genetic and nongenetic mechanisms, which can be equally important, predict correlations between behavior and body mass on different levels (e.g., genetic and environmental) of variation. We investigated multilevel relationships between body mass measured on weeks 1, 2, and 3 and three behavioral responses to handling, measured on week 3, which form a behavioral syndrome in wild blue tit nestlings. Using 7 years of data and quantitative genetic models, we find that all behaviors and body mass on week 3 are heritable (h2 = 0.18-0.23) and genetically correlated, whereas earlier body masses are not heritable. We also find evidence for environmental correlations between body masses and behaviors. Interestingly, these environmental correlations have different signs for early and late body masses. Altogether, these findings indicate genetic integration between body mass and behavior and illustrate the impacts of early environmental factors and environmentally mediated growth trajectory on behaviors expressed later in life. This study, therefore, suggests that the relationship between personality and body mass in developing individuals is due to various underlying mechanisms, which can have opposing effects. Future research on the link between behavior and body mass would benefit from considering these multiple mechanisms simultaneously.","tags":null,"title":"Contrasting multilevel relationships between behavior and body mass in blue tit nestlings","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jon Brommer","Barbara Class","Giovanny Covarrubias-Pazaran"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1576454400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1576454400,"objectID":"3fe80fcc875e0f936c04d90239b220c7","permalink":"https://barbaraclass.com/publication/brommer_etal_ecoevorxiv_2019/","publishdate":"2019-12-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/brommer_etal_ecoevorxiv_2019/","section":"publication","summary":"Multivariate mixed models (MMM) are generalized linear models with both fixed and random effect having multiple response variables.  MMM allow partitioning of total (phenotypic) (co)variances for multiple traits into (co)variances on hierarchically lower levels.

We consider biological levels of interest to be genes (e.g. GWAS, genomic selection), genotypes (genetic (co)variances), individual or other subject (e.g. between-individual (co)variances) and phylogenetic taxa (phylogenetic (co)variances). All of these biological levels can be modelled in a MMM and we distinguish several demand levels of using MMM of increasing complexity. We present an overview of current open-access software implementations of MMM in the open software R with respect to these demand levels, and present example scripts aimed at getting started with MMM on all biological levels. We describe four freely available R packages for MMM, two using Bayesian (Monte Carlo and Hamiltonian Markov Chains) and two using a likelihood framework. Depending on the need of the analyst, there are a number of freely available R-based MMM implementations of relevance to the field of ecology and evolution.","tags":null,"title":"Multivariate Mixed Models in Ecology and Evolutionary biology: Inferences and implementation in R","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Academic is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience.

Indeed, behaviors that reflect an individual's personality can respond to environmental factors or change with age. To date, little is known regarding personality changes during a wild animals' lifetime and even less about stability in heritability of behavior across ages. In this study, we investigated age‐related changes in the mean and in the additive genetic variance of exploratory behavior, a commonly used measure of animal personality, in a wild population of great tits. Heritability of exploration is reduced in adults compared to juveniles, with a low genetic correlation across these age classes. A random regression animal model confirmed the occurrence of genotype–age interactions (G×A) in exploration, causing a decrease in additive genetic variance before individuals become 1 year old, and a decline in cross‐age genetic correlations between young and increasingly old individuals. Of the few studies investigating G×A in behaviors, this study provides rare evidence for this phenomenon in an extensively studied behavior. We indeed demonstrate that heritability and cross‐age genetic correlations in this behavior are not stable over an individual's lifetime, which can affect its potential response to selection. Because G×A is likely to be common in behaviors and have consequences for our understanding of the evolution of animal personality, more attention should be turned to this phenomenon in the future work.","tags":null,"title":"Exploratory behavior undergoes genotype–age interactions in a wild bird","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Barbara Class","Edward Kluen","Jon Brommer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1558742400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1558742400,"objectID":"30bb7e82a2147d9a0758e044ec90b6cc","permalink":"https://barbaraclass.com/publication/class_etal_jeb_2019/","publishdate":"2019-05-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/class_etal_jeb_2019/","section":"publication","summary":"Indirect sexual selection arises when reproductive individuals choose their mates based on heritable ornaments that are genetically correlated to fitness.

In this study, we investigate the quantitative genetic relationship between different aspects of tail structural colouration (brightness, hue and UV chroma) and performance (cell‐mediated immunity, body mass and wing length) in blue tit (Cyanistes caeruleus) nestlings. In line with previous studies, we find low heritability for structural colouration and moderate heritability for performance measures. Multivariate animal models show positive genetic correlations between the three measures of performance, indicating quantitative genetic variation for overall performance, and tail brightness and UV chroma, two genetically independent colour measures, are genetically correlated with performance (positively and negatively, respectively). Our results suggest that mate choice based on independent aspects of tail colouration can have fitness payoffs in blue tits and provide support for the indirect benefits hypothesis.

This correlation is often assumed to reflect non-random mate choice based on phenotypic similarity. However, phenotypic resemblance between mates can also arise when their traits respond plastically to a shared environmental effect creating a (within-pair) residual correlation in traits. Using long-term data collected in pairs of wild blue tits and a covariance partitioning approach, we empirically demonstrate that such residual covariance indeed exists and can generate phenotypic correlations (or mask assortative mating) in behavioural and morphometric traits. These findings (i) imply that residual covariance is likely to be common and bias phenotypic estimates of assortative mating, which can have consequences for evolutionary predictions, (ii) call for the use of rigorous statistical approaches in the study of assortative mating, and (iii) show the applicability of one of these approaches in a common study system.","tags":null,"title":"Shared environmental effects bias phenotypic estimates of assortative mating in a wild bird","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"For my first post-doc, I continued to apply quantitative genetics methods to study evolutionary questions in wild birds.

Theories of partner selection and quantitative genetics assume that phenotypic resemblance of partners captures associations in “intrinsically determined” trait values. However, when considering traits with a repeatability below one (labile traits or traits measured with error), the correlation between phenotypes of paired individuals can arise from shared environmental effects on the phenotypes of paired individuals or correlated measurement error. We introduce statistical approaches to estimate assortative mating in labile traits or traits measured with error in the presence of shared environmental effects. These approaches include (1) the correlation between the mean phenotypes of males and females, (2) the correlation between randomized values of individuals and (3) the between-pair correlation derived from a bivariate mixed model. We use simulations to show that the performance of these different approaches depends on the number of repeated measures within individuals or pairs, which is determined by study design, and rates of survival and divorce. We conclude that short-term environmental effects on phenotypes of paired individuals likely inflate estimates of assortative mating when not statistically accounted for. Our approach allows investigation of this important issue in assortative mating studies for labile traits (e.g. behaviour, physiology, or metabolism) in both socially monogamous and other mating systems, and groupings of individuals outside a mating context.","tags":null,"title":"A statistical methodology for estimating assortative mating for phenotypic traits that are labile or measured with error","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jon Brommer","Barbara Class"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1485993600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1485993600,"objectID":"6ee192fe0de3ae3edf29c14a13daf3f0","permalink":"https://barbaraclass.com/publication/brommer_class_beas_2017/","publishdate":"2017-02-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/brommer_class_beas_2017/","section":"publication","summary":"The presence of variation in behavior on the between-individual level is considered the hallmark of personality. In contrast, behavioral syndromes are commonly recognized when documented on the phenotypic level, which is a mix of between-individual and residual (within-individual) correlations. Phenotypic and between-individual correlations need not align, and investigations on different levels of the same syndrome may hence lead to opposite inferences. Between-individual correlations, arguably, provide stronger evidence for an intrinsically determined behavioral syndrome than phenotypic correlations. We compiled 109 literature estimates of between-individual and phenotypic correlations between behaviors from 30 studies, performed on 22 species covering a wide range of taxa. Contrary to our expectation, the phenotypic correlation in behaviors was, on average, a reasonable predictor of the between-individual correlation in terms of magnitude and sign. Although our finding does not warrant the use of the phenotypic correlation as a suitable approximation of the between-individual correlation for any particular study, it does suggest that the phenotypic correlations used to infer the majority of behavioral syndromes to date have provided a reasonable characterization of syndrome associative strength.","tags":null,"title":"Phenotypic correlations capture between-individual correlations underlying behavioral syndromes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Barbara Class","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo","教程"],"content":"Overview  The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

Since most personality traits are heritable and linked with fitness, ontogenetic changes can have evolutionary implications. In this paper, we explore age-related changes in two behavioral responses to handling, both of which are heritable and associated with fitness, in wild blue tits. We find that one of these responses (handling aggression), which is positively correlated with fitness, declines with age. We show that this age-related decline is not due to selective disappearance, but occurs also within individuals, which confirms that this personality trait undergoes a senescent decline in the wild. We further find that individuals differ significantly in their rate of ageing but found no statistical support for the presence of genotype-age interactions on personality. Future research on personality would benefit from a more explicit lifetime perspective.","tags":null,"title":"Senescence of personality in a wild bird","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jon Brommer","Barbara Class"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1440374400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1440374400,"objectID":"0de4e9ef7fcd1e3a0a386411957033d4","permalink":"https://barbaraclass.com/publication/brommer_class_frontierszool_2015/","publishdate":"2015-08-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/brommer_class_frontierszool_2015/","section":"publication","summary":"Behaviors are highly plastic and one aspect of this plasticity is behavioral changes over age. The presence of age-related plasticity in behavior opens up the possibility of between-individual variation in age-related plasticity (Individual-Age interaction, IxA) and genotype-age interaction (GxA). We outline the available approaches for quantifying GxA. We underline that knowledge of GxA for behaviors is an important step in reaching and understanding of the evolution of plasticity in behavior over lifetime. In particular, the heritability (repeatability) and/or the rank order of behavior across individuals are predicted to change across ages in presence of GxA. We draw on the theory of reaction norms to illustrate that GxA, when present, is likely to lead to developmental changes in the magnitude and possibly sign of the genetic correlation between behaviors (behavioral syndrome). We present an overview of the literature on changes in the ranking of individuals' behavior across ages, and in the correlation between behaviors. Although all studies were carried out on the phenotypic level, they overall suggest clear scope for increased study of GxA as a process explaining age-related plasticity in behaviors. Lastly, we throughout emphasize that many of the approaches and underlying theory of GxA is applicable to the study of IxA, which is informative as it presents the upper limit of GxA, but is also a more attainable target of study in many systems. Empirical work aimed at understanding IxA and GxA in behavior is needed in order to understand whether patterns predicted by theory on plasticity indeed occur for age-related plasticity of behavior.","tags":null,"title":"The importance of genotype-by-age interactions for the development of repeatable behavior and correlated behaviors over lifetime","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Barbara Class","Jon Brommer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1430956800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1430956800,"objectID":"c3248dc29210f8dfd436a35b8d21c02f","permalink":"https://barbaraclass.com/publication/class_brommer_prsb_2015/","publishdate":"2015-06-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/class_brommer_prsb_2015/","section":"publication","summary":"In animal populations, as in humans, behavioural differences between individuals that are consistent over time and across contexts are considered to reflect personality, and suites of correlated behaviours expressed by individuals are known as behavioural syndromes.

The existence of such consistency contrasts to the expectation based on classical behavioral theory that facultative behavior maximizes individual fitness. Here, we study two personality traits (aggression and breath rate during handling) in a wild population of blue tits during 2007-2012. Handling aggression and breath rate were moderately heritable (h2 = 0.35 and 0.20, respectively) and not genetically correlated (rA = 0.06) in adult blue tits, which permits them to evolve independently. Reciprocal cross-fostering (2007-2010) showed that offspring reared by more aggressive males have a higher probability to recruit. In addition, offspring reared by pairs mated assortatively for handling aggression had a higher recruitment probability, which is the first evidence that both parents' personalities influence their reproductive success in the wild in a manner independent of their genetic effects. Handling aggression was not subjected to survival selection in either sex, but slow-breathing females had a higher annual probability of survival as revealed by capture-mark-recapture analysis. We find no evidence for temporal fluctuations in selection, and thus conclude that directional selection (via different fitness components) acts on these two heritable personality traits. Our findings show that blue tit personality has predictable fitness consequences, but that facultative adjustment of an individual's personality to match the fitness maximum is likely constrained by the genetic architecture of personality. In the face of directional selection, the presence of heritable variation in personality suggests the existence of a trade-off that we have not identified yet.","tags":null,"title":"Evolutionary quantitative genetics of behavioral responses to handling in a wild passerine","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"My Ph.D. thesis aimed to provide a quantitative genetics overview of personality in a wild population of blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus).

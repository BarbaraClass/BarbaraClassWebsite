I am a post-doctoral researcher interested in animal behavior and its evolution in the wild. Using long term data collected in wild vertebrate populations (birds, lizards) and a variety of mixed (quantitative genetic) models, I have been studying:
- consistent among-individual differences in behavior (i.e. ‘animal personality’), their potential responses to selection, and how they change over time as individuals develop and age;
- sexual selection, in particular the processes leading to assortative mating;
- among-individual differences in social behavior and their relationship with social networks and disease ecology.

I am a post-doctoral researcher interested in animal behavior and its evolution in the wild. Using long term data collected in wild vertebrate populations (birds, lizards) and a variety of mixed (quantitative genetic) models, I have been studying:
- consistent among-individual differences in behavior (i.e. ‘animal personality’), their potential responses to selection, and how they change over time as individuals develop and age;
- sexual selection, in particular the processes leading to assortative mating;
- Mixed models' performances when applied to the study of individual differences in plasticity and phenotypic similarity between individuals

For my current postdoc at the CEFE (01/02/2022), I am investigating whether urban (Montpellier) and non-urban (Rouvière) great tit populations differ in their quantitative genetic variation for an array of traits and therefore in their potential to respond to selection in these two different habitats.
